<h1>Heap</h1>

<p>
This memory-manager is based on my <a href="http://www.github.com/svenbieg/clusters">Clusters</a> sorting-algorithm.<br />
Free space is mapped by size and by offset, so the smallest free block top most of the heap is returned.<br />

<br />

<p>
I'm still not sure about dead-locks, maybe there is an endless loop i never experienced.<br />
